This directory contains configuration files for Veewee.

 What is Veewee ?
------------------
Veewee is a tool to build Vagrant base boxes.

 What is Vagrant ?
-------------------
Vagrant is a tool for building and distributing virtualized
development environments.
http://vagrantup.com/


 Why using Vagrant and Veewee ?
--------------------------------
We chose to use Vagrant to quickly deploy pre-configured virtual machines
and run test suites on them.


 Configure your environment
----------------------------
Open a shell in the same directory as this readme.
Skip to step 3 if you already have ".box" files.
1. Build base boxes:
    $ vagrant basebox build <distribution>
  Available distributions:
    fedora-16-x86_64, opensuse-12.1-x86_64, ubuntu-oneiric-x64
  This will take a while (download distribution ISO and perform a
  full installation).

2. Test base boxes:
    $ vagrant basebox validate <distribution>

3. Add base boxes in your environment:
    $ vagrant box add <distribution> "<distribution>.box"


 Run tests in virtual machines
-------------------------------
The script "run_vm_test.sh" can be used to run another script in a
virtual machine.
    run_vm_test.sh -d <distribution> -s <script>
It will create a new virtual machine based on <distribution> and run <script>
as user "vagrant".


 How does it work ?
--------------------
1. Vagrant makes a copy of your pre-configured virtual machine
   (aka "base box"), and puts its configuration in "~/OBSLight_tests/<foo>".
2. The test script is copied in the same directory as the Vagrant files,
   which is accessible from "/vagrant/" inside the virtual machine.
3. The virtual machine is started.
4. The script is run in the virtual machine using SSH.
5. The virtual machine is stopped (but not destroyed).
