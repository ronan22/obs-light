 Why using Vagrant and Veewee ?
--------------------------------
We chose to use Vagrant to quickly deploy pre-configured virtual machines and run
test suites on them.

 Configure your environment
----------------------------
Open a shell in the same directory as this readme.
- Build base boxes:
    $ vagrant basebox build <distribution>
  Available distributions: fedora-16-x86_64, opensuse-12.1-x86_64, ubuntu-oneiric-x64
  This will take a while (download distribution ISO and perform a full installation).

- Test base boxes:
    $ vagrant basebox validate <distribution>

- Add base boxes in your environment:
    $ vagrant box add <distribution> "<distribution>.box"

 Run tests in virtual machines
-------------------------------
The script "run_vm_test.sh" can be used to run another script in a virtual machine.
    run_vm_test.sh <distribution> <script>
It will create a new virtual machine based on <distribution> and run <script> as
user "vagrant".
