obslight-fakeobs
--------------------
Python script that partially implements an OBS API.
It does not build anything, but can be used as an OBS remote link.

You can use it for example to build your own project against a fixed
release of a public project (Tizen, MeeGo...), without the drawbacks
of a slow/unreliable internet connection.

It is based on Mer Delivery System tools
http://wiki.merproject.org/index.php?title=Mer_Delivery_System

modified for the needs of OBS Light project
http://wiki.meego.com/OBS_Light

RPM packages for openSUSE 11.4 and 12.1:
http://repo.pub.meego.com/Project:/OBS_Light/
Python dependencies (python-async, python-gitdb, python-smmap):
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/python/


All commands should be run as root.

Where are fakeobs data stored ?
-------------------------------
fakeobs data are stored in /srv/fakeobs and its subdirectories.
The daemon log file is /var/log/fakeobs.log


On which port does fakeobs API listen ?
---------------------------------------
fakeobs API listens on port 8001.
You can test if it is running by calling
  http://<your_host>:8001/public/source/
in your web browser. You should see a 404 error, which
proves the daemon is listening.
If you see "Unable to connect", the daemon is probably stopped.
Try "rcfakeobs start".


On which port are published the package repositories ?
------------------------------------------------------
The package repositories are published on port 8002.


How to create a link to the fake OBS on the real OBS ?
------------------------------------------------------
- If they run on the same host (we hope so), you can run
  "obslight-fakeobs createlink", optionally with the path to your
  ".oscrc" file (without it, the script will try the default port, user
  and password of an OBS appliance http://susestudio.com/a/e0uuBG/meego-obs).
- If they don't, we suggest you to follow this guide
http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_private_instance_boot_strapping#Use_OBS_Remote_Link
  and replace
     "https://api.meego.com/public"
  by
     "http://<your_host>:8001/public"


How to import a fakeobs project from an archive ?
-------------------------------------------------
Run "obslight-fakeobs import" with the archive path as parameter,
and optionally the name of the project as second parameter
('_' in archive name will be replaced by ':' when guessing project name).
A "<project>.manifest" file will be created ; do not remove it.

Example:
$ obslight-fakeobs import Tizen_1.0_Base-1.0.tar.gz "Tizen:1.0:Base"


How to remove a fakeobs project ?
---------------------------------
Run "obslight-fakeobs remove" with the project name as parameter.

Example:
$ obslight-fakeobs remove "Tizen:1.0:Base"


Where can I find fakeobs projects archives ?
--------------------------------------------
Some archives for Tizen are available at http://tizen.fridu.net/.


Can I create fakeobs project archive myself ?
---------------------------------------------
Yes you can, but it's not documented at the moment.
You can take a look at "/srv/fakeobs/tools/grab_fakeobs_project.sh".
