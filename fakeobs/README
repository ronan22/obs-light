Where are fakeobs data stored ?

How to create a link to the fake OBS on the real OBS ?
------------------------------------------------------
- If they run on the same host (we hope so), you can run
  "obslight-fakeobs createlink", optionally with the path to your
  ".oscrc" file (without it, the script will try the default port, user
  and password of an OBS appliance http://susestudio.com/a/e0uuBG/meego-obs).
- If they don't, we suggest you to follow this guide
http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_private_instance_boot_strapping#Use_OBS_Remote_Link
  and replace
     "https://api.meego.com/public"
  by
     "http://<your_host>:8001/public"


How to import a fakeobs project from an archive ?
-------------------------------------------------
Run "obslight-fakeobs import" with the archive path as parameter,
and optionally the name of the project as second parameter
('_' in archive name will be replaced by ':' when guessing project name).
A "<project>.manifest" file will be created ; do not remove it.

Example:
$ obslight-fakeobs import Tizen_1.0_Base-1.0.tar.gz "Tizen:1.0:Base"


How to remove a fakeobs project ?
---------------------------------
Run "obslight-fakeobs remove" with the project name as parameter.

Example:
$ obslight-fakeobs remove "Tizen:1.0:Base"


Where can I find fakeobs projects archives ?
--------------------------------------------
Some archives for Tizen are available at http://tizen.fridu.net/.


Can I create fakeobs project archive myself ?
---------------------------------------------
Yes you can, but it's not documented at the moment.
You can take a look at "/srv/fakeobs/tools/grab_fakeobs_project.sh".
