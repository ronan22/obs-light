NAME
----

obslight-fakeobs-grabgbs - Grab from a GBS output of an OBS server
one or more subprojects ino the fakeobs database.


SYNOPSYS
--------

*obslight-fakeobs grabgbs* [options] -n|--name <project-name> <uri>


*obslight-fakeobs fromgbs* [options] -n|--name <project-name> <uri>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Import to the the *fakeobs* database the project given by <uri>.

The primary goal of that option of obslight-fakeobs is to import 
the GBS output of the OBS of Tizen.

The <uri> should point to a download directory of *Tizen*.
It must look something like [SCHEME:]//download.tizen.org/SUBPATH.
Where:

  - SCHEME if present is in 'rsync', 'https', 'http'. 
    If SCHEME isn't given, the above methods wil be tried in the
    given order: 'rsync' then 'https' and finally 'http'.

  - SUBPATH points to a directory that MUST contain a subdirectory 
    named 'builddata' that MUST contain the file 'build.xml'.

A such <uri> is the base uri of a *Tizen* build for GBS. It contains 
several subprojects. At least 2 subprojects: tizen-base and tizen-main.
But more can be found. Every subproject is imported to the *fakeobs* 
database as subprojects of the project named <project-name> given
with the MANDATORY option *--name <project-name>*.

Because *fakeobs* should know the dependencies betwen the imported
subprojects, the option *--order* allows to give the order of dependencies
between the subpojects.

CAUTION: An OBS builds for one or more architectures. Architectures are also named *targets*
by *fakeobs*. The imported targets must be explicitely given by the option
*--target*. If targets aren't given, nothing will be imported.

The targeted builds are built for one or several processors also designed as
'arch'. The option *--arch* allow to tell what arch is needed.

For Tizen, it is generally a good idea to check the download repository
using a web navigator. The main entry point is https://download.tizen.org/ .

OPTIONS
-------

*-n, --name <project-name>*::
    This option is _*MANDATORY*_.
    The grab creates the project of name *<project-name>* in the database of *fakeobs*.

*-t, --target <target-name>*::
    Tells that the target of name *<target-name>* is to grab. 
    Many target can be set.
    Any not listed target is left out, so at least one target have to be set.

*-a, --arch <arch-name>*::
    Tells that the arch of name *<arch-name>* is to grab. 
    Many target can be set.
    If no arch is set then all available archs are grabbed.
    You can also use *--arch '*'* to grab all the available archs.
    
    help="architecture(s) to grab, dont put anything for all archs")

*-o, --order <subproject-name>*::
    Give a the *<subproject-name>* for ordering subprojects dependencies.
    A given subproject will be made dependent of all the subprojects previously given
    using the *--order* option.

*-v, --verbose*::
    Display more information messages.

*-f, --force*::
    Don't stop if the project already exists in the database of fakeobs.
	

*-k, --rsynckeep*::
    Don't remove the internally synchronized files.
    Use that option for example on a lastest built if you wanted to further update
    it using the --force option.
 

EXAMPLES
--------

[source,shell]
obslight-fakeobs grabgbs -t ia32 -a i586 -a i686 -o tizen-base -o tizen-main -n Tizen:r2.0a http://download.tizen.org/releases/2.0alpha/daily/latest/


Using the above command, you grab from //download.tizen.org/releases/2.0alpha (that
doesn't offer rsync facility) all the subprojects, making the subproject +tizen-main+
depend of the subproject +tizen-base+. 

Because rsync is active for snapshots, the following command is valid.

[source,shell]
obslight-fakeobs grabgbs -t ia32 -o tizen-base -o tizen-main -n Tizen:2.0 -k -f rsync://download.tizen.org/snapshots/2.0alpha/common/latest/

That command can be used to track the latest snapshot.

KNOWN ISSUE
-----------

The contents of the ':full' subdirectories can't be grabed but must be guessed.
It actually works for 'i686' and 'i586' archs, not for arm.
