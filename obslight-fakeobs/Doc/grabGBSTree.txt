The Grab of GBS Trees
=====================


CAUTION
-------

Because the primary goal of that option was to import 
Tizen 2.0 alpha, the option is devloped on HTTP protocol
not RSYNC what could be a good alternative.


HOW DOES IT WORKS ?
-------------------

The given URL should be a path like 

http://download.tizen.org/releases/2.0alpha/daily/latest/
or
rsync://download.tizen.org/releases/2.0alpha/daily/latest/

That path point to a directory that MUST contain the 
subdirectories:

  - builddata
  - images
  - repos

The builddata subdirectory  MUST have the file build.xml.
Here is an example of the content of a build.xml file:

<build>
  <archs>
    <arch>ia32</arch>
    <arch>armv7l</arch>
  </archs>
  <repos>
    <repo>tizen-base</repo>
    <repo>tizen-main</repo>
  </repos>
  <buildconf>
    a300db37ca06dc0948bf006eaf2a15fa0481ac5ef64e1a71695bd6b84901f667-build.conf
  </buildconf>
  <id>tizen-2.0_20120926.2</id>
</build>

The algo is:

  1. Get the file URL/builddata/build.xml
  1.1. read it and record the archs and repos and confs



To do that, a class GbsTree is created that encapsulate the 
difference of behaviours between the rsync and the http mode.


HOW TO USE A PROXY
------------------

For HTTP ansd HTTPS, use the environment variables
http_proxy=host:port
https_proxy=host:port
